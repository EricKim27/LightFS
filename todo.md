# TO-DO:
## fill_superblock

look for ways to read bitmap.

bitmap : only 0 and 1, filled with 2 if all the blocks are checked. This was made to make a filesystem that has all the structures fit in inside the 1024 * N byte range.

## inode ops
think of a way of reading inode structures. size will be 256 bytes.
